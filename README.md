### Changes Summary: // 11-08-2024
- **Loading setup via CLI argument:** If the `--setup` argument is provided, the script will load the corresponding `.json` file and run the bot directly without displaying the menu.
- **Menu display:** If no `--setup` argument is provided, the script will display the menu as usual.
- **Setup saving:** The option to save setups has been included in the menu as option `8`.

This will allow you to run the script directly with a predefined setup like this:

```bash
python main.py --setup mysetup
```

2. User agent is not random but static on each account
